/**
 * The open evaluation core, as something another package can actually import.
 *
 * `packages/eval` had no entry point and no `main`: everything in it was
 * reachable only as a script run from its own directory. CLAUDE.md says the
 * open core must be usable on its own, and it was not — the first consumer
 * outside this package had nowhere to import from.
 *
 * What is exported is the part that is genuinely reusable: the deterministic
 * checks and the corpus they run against. The condition A/B pipeline stays
 * internal, because it encodes one experiment rather than a general facility.
