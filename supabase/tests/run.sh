# Run the database proofs in this directory and decide whether they passed.
#
# These are not pgTAP, despite living in `supabase/tests/`. Each is a single
# `do $$ … $$` block that builds a verdict string and ends with a deliberate
# `raise exception`, so the transaction rolls back and the database is left
# exactly as it was found. `supabase test db` would be the wrong tool: it
# expects pgTAP, and every one of these scripts exits non-zero on success.
#
# **The exit code therefore proves nothing, and neither does the marker.** A
# script that aborted early — a missing table, a renamed function — also exits
# non-zero, and one that reached its raise still reports every individual check
# inside the message. So this reads the verdict:
#
#     ISOLATION >> A-sees-own-org=t(want t); creator-role=owner(want owner); …
#
# and fails when any pair disagrees with what it wanted. A run that produces no
# verdict line at all is a failure too — that is the aborted-early case, and
# treating it as a pass is exactly how a proof becomes decoration.
#
# **Values are not only `t` and `f`.** This matched `=[tf](want [tf])` and
# silently dropped every other pair. Not a cosmetic limit: of the 13 checks in
# tenant-isolation.sql it counted 7, and the 6 it ignored were
# `creator-role=owner` and every cross-tenant *read* — `B-sees-A-org`,
# `B-sees-A-proj`, `B-sees-A-members`. Those are the assertions that file exists
# for, and `B-sees-A-proj=1(want 0)` would still have been reported as
# `ok — 7 check(s)`.
#
# It surfaced only because role-permissions.sql is entirely numeric, so nothing
# in it matched at all and it tripped "verdict line carries no checks" — the
# guard that exists for aborted scripts, doing the job by accident on a script
# that had run perfectly.
