/**
 * The application shell's navigation, built on shadcn's Sidebar.
 *
 * This replaces a hand-rolled 240px column plus a separate sheet in the topbar
 * that duplicated the same links. What the shadcn component brings is not
 * styling — every colour here is a Localize Infra token — but behaviour that
 * was never going to be written by hand and kept correct: collapse to an icon
 * rail, a ⌘B shortcut, the collapsed state persisted across sessions, the rail
 * as a drag target, and an automatic Sheet presentation below the mobile
 * breakpoint with its own focus management.
 *
 * The identity work is in the mapping: `--sidebar` resolves to our surface,
 * `--sidebar-accent` to our active ground, `--sidebar-ring` to the Iris focus
 * ring. shadcn's generated defaults shipped a blue ring, which this product's
 * colour discipline does not allow.

       * It first read "No project connected. Everything shown is sample data."
       * — correct when nothing was real, and false once the workspace, its
       * projects and its runs began reading the database. It was narrowed to
       * "The screens listed above show sample data. Your workspace, projects
       * and runs are real", with a comment stating that the routes in the nav
       * above "genuinely are still stubs".
       *
       * They are not. `/ambiguity`, `/review`, `/runs` and `/locales` all call
       * `requireSession` and query Postgres; `nav.ts` carried `sample: true` on
       * three of them until the flags were corrected against the screens. Only
       * `/` renders a sample dashboard, and a signed-in reader never reaches it
       * — `app/page.tsx` redirects them to their workspace. So for every reader
       * with a session, the sentence claimed that five real surfaces were
       * invented.
       *
       * The second half was no better: with no database there is nothing real
       * to reassure anybody about, so "your workspace, projects and runs are
       * real" was false in exactly the case the note was meant for.
       *
       * The note's own first comment says why this matters: a banner asserting
       * that real data is invented is the same defect as presenting invented
       * data as real, pointing the other way. It is now shown only where it is
       * true — no database — and says what is actually on screen there.
