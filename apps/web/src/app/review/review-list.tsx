/**
 * The wording a run is waiting on somebody to accept, grouped by the run.
 *
 * ## Every card used to be green
 *
 * The list painted `tone="confident"` on all of them, so the colour meant
 * "row". §6.2 allows colour to express the state of something that exists and
 * §6.3 forbids it as decoration; a palette where every item is the same colour
 * is the second thing wearing the clothes of the first.
 *
 * The right tone was available and unused. `listReviewItemsForViewer` selects
 * only from runs whose status is `awaiting_review` — every proposal on this
 * page is, by construction, a thing a person has to decide about. That is
 * §1.4's reserved meaning for Iris, stated exactly: *your judgement is
 * required*. This is the surface the reservation was made for.
 *
 * ## Grouped, because a flat list hid which run was asking
 *
 * The rows arrive from up to ten runs across every language, sorted by locale
 * and key, so two consecutive cards could belong to different runs and the only
 * clue was a small label. A reviewer deciding about a run needs to see that
 * run's proposals together, and needs the way to reach it.
 *
 * ## The proposal is the subject, the source is the context
 *
 * Source text was `text-body text-primary` and the proposed wording
 * `text-body text-secondary` — the thing being asked about rendered lighter
 * than the thing it replaces. They are two columns now, source muted on the
 * left and proposal in full weight on the right, which is also the shape of the
 * question: this becomes that.
 *
 * ## No approve button, and that is not an omission
 *
 * Approving a run commits its whole proposal, and it happens on the project
 * page beside the questions it depends on. There is no way to accept one key
 * and reject another, so a per-string control here would promise a granularity
 * the pipeline does not have. What this page can do is take the reader there,
 * which the run link does — replacing a sentence that told them to go.
