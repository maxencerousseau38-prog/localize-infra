 * Japanese in a Latin-first fallback is the fastest way for a localization
 * product to prove it does not care.
 *
 * Loading them here rather than in packages/ui is deliberate — next/font must
 * be called from the app that owns the document. apps/site does not load them
 * because it renders no translated copy.
 *
 * Google splits these into unicode-range chunks and next/font preserves that,
