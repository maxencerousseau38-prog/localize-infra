 * Billing, which currently bills nothing.
 *
 * The marketing site says, in public: "There is no billing system, and nothing
 * is charged today", and "Public repositories: Free. Unlimited, permanently."
 * This page has to agree with both — a workspace surface implying a card on
 * file, a trial clock or a usage bar would make /pricing a lie, and the whole
 * argument that page makes is that this product does not do that.
 *
 * So there is no invoice list, no payment method, no usage meter. There is what
 * the workspace can do today, and an honest account of what is not built.
