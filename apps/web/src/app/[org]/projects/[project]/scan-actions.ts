/**
 * Look at a repository and say what a run would do, without doing it.
 *
 * The brief's first-value screen wants real numbers before a developer commits
 * to anything: how many keys, how many locales, how much is missing. Every one
 * of those was already computed — but only *during* a run, interleaved with the
 * model calls that cost money. A developer had to pay to find out whether it
 * was worth paying.
 *
 * This is the same first half of the pipeline, stopping where the spending
 * starts. It calls `materialiseRepository`, `detectFramework`,
 * `extractFromProject` and `readLocaleFile` — the run's own functions, not
 * copies — so what it reports and what the run does cannot drift.
 *
 * **It writes nothing.** No `runs` row is created, deliberately: a scan is not
 * a run, and inserting one would put a row that translated nothing into the
 * activation funnel and into the history a developer reads. The cost of
 * recomputing on the next visit is a tarball and a directory walk, with no
 * model call in it.
