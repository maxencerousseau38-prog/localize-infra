 * One run: detect, extract, translate, open a pull request.

 * The same sequence the CLI performs, against a repository fetched from GitHub
 * instead of a local clone, and calling the same API the CLI calls rather than
 * re-implementing translation — one prompt, in one place.
 *
 * **It runs inside the request, and that is a limitation rather than a
 * design.** A repository with hundreds of strings across several locales will
 * outlive a serverless timeout and there is no worker to resume it. What the
 * request does guarantee is that a run is never silently lost: the row is
 * written before any work starts and closed in a finally block, so a crash
 * leaves a failed run carrying its reason instead of a row stuck at "running".
 *
 * This said "operator-gated for the same reason connecting a repository is —
 * one shared installation reaches every repository it was ever granted", which
 * the body of the function has contradicted since the gate was removed.
 *
 * Reading the repository and writing the pull request now act as the same
 * installation — the workspace's own. They did not: `/v1/open-pr` took no
 * installation id, so every tenant's pull request came out of whichever one the
 * API had in its environment, and a workspace the operator's installation did
 * not cover would translate and then fail at the last step. The id is resolved
 * once here, by `installationIdFor`, and used for both halves.
