 * Whether this workspace has its own GitHub installation, and how to get one.

 * product and a demo, so none of them is smoothed over:
 *
 *  - **connected** — the workspace installed the App itself. Its token reaches
 *    its own repositories and nothing else. This is the real thing.
 *  - **available** — nothing connected yet, and a customer can do it now.
 *  - **unavailable** — the App has no OAuth client secret, so the callback
 *    cannot prove that whoever completes it actually owns the installation it
 *    names. The button is absent rather than disabled, and the reason is
 *    stated, because a flow that stores an unverified installation id is an
 *    account takeover wearing a feature's clothes.
