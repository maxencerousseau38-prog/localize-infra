 * config file and extracts strings by parsing source with ts-morph. Rewriting
 * it to read from an API would fork the one piece of this product that is
 * already proven, so the repository is brought to it instead.
 *
 * The tree is fetched recursively in one request and only source-shaped files
 * are downloaded. A repository with a large binary in it would otherwise cost
 * a blob request per file and a great deal of memory for data no parser reads.

 * attacker-controlled by whoever owns the repository. That was tolerable while
 * the only reachable repositories were ours. It stops being tolerable the
 * moment a customer installs the App on a repository they wrote, which is the
