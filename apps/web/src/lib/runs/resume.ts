/**
 * What a previous run already bought, so this one does not buy it twice.
 *
 * A run is one serverless request and every chunk of every locale is awaited in
 * turn, so wall-clock is the whole sum and the platform cuts it at its timeout.
 * Before this, the cut discarded everything: `record_run_translations` writes
 * once after the locale loop, and a run that dies opens no pull request, so a
 * customer could be billed for six languages and receive none.
 *
 * `translation_cache` holds model output per (project, locale, key). This
 * module is the two ends of it — read what is already paid for, write each
 * locale the moment it lands.
 *
 * **It is a cache, in the sense invariant 1 means.** Git stays the source of
 * truth. Every way this can go wrong costs a wasted row or a repeated
 * translation; none of them can produce a wrong translation, because a hit
 * requires the source text to match exactly.

 * ship something stale and call it a saving.
