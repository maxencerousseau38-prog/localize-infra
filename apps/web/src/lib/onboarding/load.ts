/**
 * The guided path for one workspace, read under RLS.
 *
 * Four reads against tables that already exist, in parallel, the same shape as
 * `lib/metrics/load.ts` — and for the same reason: there is no onboarding table
 * and there is not going to be one. Progress is a *view* of the rows the
 * product already writes, so it cannot drift from them. A stored
 * `completed_steps` column would be a second account of the same facts, and the
 * first symptom of the two disagreeing would be a checklist telling somebody to
 * connect a repository they connected an hour ago.
 *
 * `installBlockers()` is the one input that is not a row. It reads this
 * deployment's environment, and it belongs here because "you cannot connect
 * GitHub" and "you have not connected GitHub yet" are different sentences with
 * different readers — one is addressed to an operator, the other to a customer.
