/**
 * What a workspace may spend from the browser.
 *
 * ## Why this exists at all
 *
 * `apps/api` protects a personal CLI token and deliberately exempts the
 * operator token, on the stated grounds that it is "held by `apps/web`, which
 * has its own guards". `apps/web` had none. Every "Run pipeline" click reached
 * a paid model on the operator's account with no rate window and no daily
 * ceiling, which made the browser the cheapest way to spend somebody else's
 * money in this product.
 *
 * ## Why here and not in the API
 *
 * The API authenticates a *token*, not a workspace. The operator bearer carries
 * no organization, and `/v1/translate` has no field that would name one — so
 * charging there would mean changing the request contract for every caller,
 * including `@localize-infra/cli@0.1.0`, which is published and parses strictly.
 *
 * `apps/web` already knows the workspace, already holds the service-role key,
 * and is the only holder of the operator bearer. Enforcing here costs no
 * protocol change and cannot be bypassed by a customer, because the server
 * action re-reads the workspace under RLS before it charges anything.
 *
 * ## Why it charges the same counters
 *
 * `consume_api_quota` and `api_usage_daily` are reused exactly as they are. The
 * daily ceiling was always keyed by workspace; the browser was simply never
 * counted against it. One workspace now has one ceiling whichever way it
 * spends, which is what the number always claimed to mean.
