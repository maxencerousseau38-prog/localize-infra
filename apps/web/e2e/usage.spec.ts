/**
 * The usage surface, against real rows and real policies.
 *
 * Two things are worth testing here and neither is a number:
 *
 *  1. **Zero is printed, and printed honestly.** The seed creates no
 *     `api_usage_daily` rows, so this workspace has genuinely spent nothing —
 *     and `consume_api_quota` writes a row on first use, which is what makes
 *     "0 of 5000" a fact rather than a missing measurement. A page that showed
 *     "No data" here would be hiding an answer it has.
 *  2. **The isolation is the database's.** Another workspace's usage is a 404,
 *     for the same reason its projects are: the policies return nothing, so
 *     there is nothing to distinguish "not yours" from "does not exist".
 *
 * Targets port 3212 — the server that inherits the ambient environment — and
 * skips without a database, like every other authenticated spec.
