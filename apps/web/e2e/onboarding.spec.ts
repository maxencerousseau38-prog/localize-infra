/**
 * The journey this product is sold on, walked by somebody who has nothing.
 *
 * Every other authenticated spec signs in as the seeded `acceptance` account,
 * which already has a workspace and two projects. That is the right fixture for
 * testing surfaces and the wrong one for testing *arrival*: the seeded account
 * can never be on the first step, so nothing exercised the screens a real new
 * user meets first. This file creates its own account for exactly that reason.
 *
 * ## Why it creates, and why serially
 *
 * `workspace.spec.ts` warns that a suite creating a workspace every run "fails
 * on the unique slug the second time" — so both the email and the slug here
 * carry a random suffix. A shared fixture could not work anyway: the subject is
 * a workspace with no history, and the first run would destroy it.
 *
 * `describe.serial` with one page for the whole block is not a convenience. Six
 * independent tests would mean six sign-ups per run, and these accounts are
 * real rows in whatever database the suite is pointed at — ephemeral in CI,
 * long-lived on a developer machine pointed at the dev project. One account per
 * journey also happens to be the honest shape of the thing being tested: a
 * person arrives once and walks forward.
 *
 * Nothing else reads these rows, so no parallel test can race them.
 *
 * Local sign-up needs no email confirmation — `supabase/config.toml` sets
 * `enable_confirmations = false` — so the account is usable immediately.

/**
 * Unique per run: two runs against one database must not collide.
 *
 * **`example.com`, not `localize-infra.dev`.** The seeded account uses the
 * latter, which works only because the seed inserts it in SQL and skips the
 * auth API entirely. Going through sign-up the way a real visitor does, a
 * hosted Supabase project answers `Email address "…@localize-infra.dev" is
 * invalid` — the domain has never been registered (CLAUDE.md records the same
 * fact about the site's canonical URL), so it has no MX record. `example.com`
 * is reserved by RFC 2606 for exactly this and does have one, so the journey
 * runs against CI's local stack and a developer's hosted project alike.

 * registered, so the reply cannot be used to enumerate accounts. But when the
 * project has email confirmation switched off, `supabase.auth.signUp` also
 * returns a session, the SSR client writes the cookies, and the visitor is
 * signed in before they have read the sentence telling them to check their
 * inbox. A hosted project with confirmations *on* stays on the form.
 *
 * Waiting for only one of those is how this helper failed the first time it
 * ran. It now waits for whichever arrives and signs in explicitly if needed —
 * so the suite behaves the same against CI's local stack and a developer's
 * hosted dev project, which is the whole point of a journey test.
