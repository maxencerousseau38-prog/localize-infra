     * are billed against this ceiling. Measured 2026-08-21 on this
     * repository's own prompt and corpus: at 40 strings the model spent all
     * 4096 tokens reasoning and emitted an empty content block, so `translate`
     * below threw and the run failed. Reproduced at 80. A 100-string batch at
     * the effort below needed 5,603.
     *
     * **16384 since 2026-08-24**, because that last figure changed. Tuning
     * escalation to the owner's target added a `cue` field the model fills
     * before answering, and output per string went from 60 to 73 measured on
     * the same 414-entry corpus. A full 100-string chunk now emits about
     * 7,300 — still under 8192, but past the headroom a chunk needs, since a
     * string the model escalates costs roughly 239 tokens rather than 73 and
     * a chunk with a dozen of them would have truncated.
     *
     * `packages/pricing/src/model.test.ts` caught this, not a production
     * failure: it asserts a chunk fits under 75% of the ceiling, and 7,300
     * against 6,144 failed the moment the measured input was updated.
     *
     * Raised rather than chunking smaller because this ceiling is billed on
     * what is emitted, not on what is allowed. Halving the chunk size would
     * have re-sent the system prompt twice as often and paid for it in input
     * tokens; raising the ceiling costs nothing until the tokens are actually
     * used.
