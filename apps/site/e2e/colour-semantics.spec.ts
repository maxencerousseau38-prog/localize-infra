/**
 * Jade means something happened (DESIGN.md §6.1): verified, current, merged,
 * passing. Unlike Iris it cannot be checked as an absolute here, because the
 * site paints it in six honest places — the run artifact, "Working today",
 * the WORKING rows on the status board, measured results on /benchmarks and
 * /quality, Shipped on /roadmap, and the free-public-repositories rule on
 * /pricing. Every one of those reports a real outcome.
 *
 * So the rule has to be pinned where it was actually broken. The landing page
 * draws the five pipeline stages twice: once in the hero as a run that really
 * executed, and once in "How it works" as a diagram of what the stages are.
 * The diagram had a jade node on Detect and neutral nodes on the other four —
 * no run, but a colour saying stage one passed, sitting a screen below an
 * artifact that had just taught the reader jade means "this stage finished".
 * It read as a pipeline that stops after Detect.
 *
 * The Iris sweep above could never have caught it, and nothing else did.
 *
 * Both halves below are load-bearing. The first forbids state on the diagram;
 * the second requires it on the real run, so the first can never be satisfied
 * by draining the colour out of the surface that has genuinely earned it.
 * All four families are checked, not just jade — the same mistake reads
 * identically in amber or crimson.
