 * compared two frames of a running `transition-colors` and passed on the
 * interpolation alone, and `CSS.forcePseudoState` is a DevTools affordance that
 * `getComputedStyle` observes only sometimes — under parallel load it reported
 * missing pressed states on surfaces that plainly have them.
 *
 * So this reads the generated rules directly. It answers the two questions that
 * actually matter, with no timing in either: does the surface declare a pressed
 * background distinct from its hover background, and does that declaration come
 * later in the sheet, so it wins when both states are true at once.
