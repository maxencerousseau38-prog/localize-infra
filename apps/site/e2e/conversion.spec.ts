/**
 * The conversion flow.
 *
 * Three things are worth pinning here, and only one of them is visible on the
 * live site today:
 *
 *  1. The gate sits after the evidence, not before it. A visitor should
 *     understand the product and see the real pull request before anything asks
 *     them for something.
 *  2. It collects nothing. This site has no auth backend — accounts live on the
 *     hosted app's own origin — so a sign-up form here would be the simulation
 *     this project forbids, and it would cost the reader their email address to
 *     discover that.
 *  3. Someone who already has access is never interrupted. That branch is
 *     unreachable today and is the most expensive one to get wrong, so it is
 *     asserted at the source rather than through the UI.
