            ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
            Seven of this page's eight section headings were `text-title`
            — 20px in the body face — while "Sub-processors", directly among
            them, used `font-display text-headline` like every section heading
            on /docs, /pricing, /roadmap, /benchmarks, /quality and the
            landing page. The site has a coherent two-tier system: the display
            face for a section of the page, `text-title` for a heading inside
            a boxed aside. /security was the only page applying the aside tier
            to its top level, so its sections read as subordinate to nothing,
            and one of the eight read differently from its neighbours for no
            reason a reader could find.

            It matters most here. This is the page arguing that the product
            states things precisely, and it was the least typographically
            settled page on the site.

                all" and promised the future one would hold "never your
                translations". The database exists, and run_translations holds
                every string a hosted run extracted and every translation it

              The CLI stores nothing with us. The hosted app keeps a database in
              Paris holding accounts, workspaces, projects, the GitHub
              installation each workspace connected, and a record of every run —
              including the strings it extracted and the translations it
              proposed, so that a run held for review opens exactly the pull
              request that was reviewed.

              Those rows are proposals, not the record: what ships is the pull
              request. Deleting a project deletes its runs and their proposals
              with it.
