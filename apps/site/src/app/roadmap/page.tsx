/**
 * Three states, each checkable.
 *
 * This page had "Being built" and "Planned", and both were wrong in the same
 * direction as the landing page's status board:
 *
 *   - "Being built" held placeholder-aware extraction and the typed SDK.
 *     Extraction had not changed since 2026-08-02, and no SDK code or commit
 *     existed. Nothing was being built.
 *   - "Planned" held the ambiguity review queue and hosted accounts, both of
 *     which were already deployed.
 *
 * So `building` is gone. `unproven` is for what exists and is deployed but has
 * never done its job on a real run — a different claim from "shipped", and one
 * a reader should be able to tell apart.
