/**
 * The three commitments.
 *
 * The previous version was three equal cards, which flattened the most
 * interesting thing about this content: each promise is at a *different stage
 * of being kept*. One is working, one is half-built, one is a commitment with
 * no code behind it — and that distinction was a line of small grey text at the
 * bottom of each card.
 *
 * The status is the organising principle: each promise carries its honest state
 * as a badge, and the State Rule runs down the leading edge coloured by whether
 * the promise is actually kept. A reader scanning the rules alone gets the
 * truth.
 *
 * **This paragraph described full-width rows — "the promise at heading scale
 * with its honest state directly beneath, prose to the right".** That version
 * was replaced by the three abreast below, for the reason the implementation
 * comment gives, and this docstring kept describing it. Two accounts of the
 * same component, sixty lines apart, disagreeing about its shape.
 *
 * The rule's tone tracks delivery, not subject matter — the second commitment
 * is *about* ambiguity but is *degraded* in practice, and Iris means one thing
 * in this system: your judgement is required. It is not spent on roadmap state.
