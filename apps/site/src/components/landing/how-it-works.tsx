/**
 * The pipeline, drawn.
 *
 * This was four numbered paragraphs of roughly sixty words each — the section a
 * reader consults to find out what happens to their repository, written as a
 * document. Nobody reads four paragraphs to decide whether to try a CLI, and
 * the sequence, which is the actual argument, was carried only by the numbers.
 *
 * It is now the five canonical stages as a connected rail, one clause each,
 * every clause taken from `PIPELINE_STAGES` so the words here cannot drift from
 * the words in the product (DESIGN.md §1.4). The prose that used to explain
 * Escalate is spent instead on showing one — because the claim that the agent
 * surfaces ambiguity rather than guessing is the difference between this and a
 * translation API, and it is the only claim on the page that needs an example
 * to land.
 *
 * That example carries no Iris, and the reason is worth keeping next to the
 * code rather than only at the call site: it depicts an unresolved string, so
 * Iris looks like the honest choice, but nobody reading a marketing page is
 * being asked to resolve anything. Spending the product's one
 * judgement-required signal on an illustration of itself is the dilution
 * §1.4 forbids, and a site-wide test enforces the absence.
 *
 * This docstring used to claim the opposite — "the one place Iris appears on
 * this site" — describing a version that shipped before the tone was changed
 * to neutral, twenty lines above an implementation comment saying exactly the
 * reverse.

       *   640…1023 two columns, no spine
       *   ≥1024   five columns, horizontal rail
       *
       * The middle tier is the one that needed care. This section was 1477px
       * at 768 with the rail alone taking 487 of it — five stages stacked down
       * a 720px-wide column, each about 360px narrower than it had room for.
       *
       * The spine is *removed* there rather than duplicated, and that is the
       * whole design. A vertical connector drawn down two columns is literally
       * two pipelines side by side, which is the failure the previous version
       * of this comment refused to risk — rightly. Without it the ordinals do
       * the work they were always for: 01…05 in reading order, no line
       * implying a flow the layout cannot honour.
       *
       * Below 640 the columns would be ~171px, too narrow for a stage summary
       * plus a mono artifact path, so that tier keeps the spine unchanged.
