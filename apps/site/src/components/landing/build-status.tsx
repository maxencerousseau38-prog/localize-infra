/**
 * The honesty section, as a status board.
 *
 * Most pre-launch sites present the roadmap as though it shipped. This one
 * states plainly what runs today and what does not — which is both the correct
 * thing to do and, given the product's positioning on not guessing, the only
 * consistent thing to do.
 *
 * The previous version split that into three parallel columns, which asked the
 * reader to scan sideways to answer "is X built?" — the one question this
 * section exists for. One continuous board answers it by reading down.
 *
 * **Only what works carries colour.** Jade marks shipped capability; everything
 * unshipped is graphite. That is the palette rule applied to the product's own
 * maturity, and it replaces an Iris that had leaked onto "in development" —
 * Iris means your judgement is required, and it is not spent on roadmap state.
 *
 * **"In development" is gone because nothing was in development.** Four rows
 * wore it. One — hosted accounts and projects — had shipped. One — the review
 * queue — was built and deployed but has never handled a real question. Three —
 * the SDK, the non-developer surface, billing — had no code and no commits.
 * "In development" told a reader work was under way on all four. The states
 * below say which of those each one is.

                      Eight of thirteen rows are `working`, so the right-hand
                      column was the word WORKING eight times over — the most
                      repetitive element on the page, drawing the eye to the
                      rows that need it least. The five that are not shipped are
                      what a reader comes to this section for, and they were set
                      in the same type as the eight that are.

                      The jade tick already carries `working`, and it carries it
                      without colour: the shape differs from the circle and the
                      dash, so §13's rule that colour is never the only carrier
                      is satisfied by the mark, not by the label. The other four
                      states share two glyphs between them, so for those the
                      word is the only thing that separates "built but unused"
                      from "not started" — and there it stays.

                      Screen readers lose nothing. The label is still rendered
                      for every row; on the shipped ones it is `sr-only`, so the
                      list reads identically and only looks different.
